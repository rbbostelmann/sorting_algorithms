# sorting_algorithms
<p>This is my attempt to implement some sorting algorithms that were introduced in week 3 of CS50x, and to better understand how the logic and the recursion work. So far, the algorithms in this repository are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> selection sort;</li>
  <li> bubble sort; and</li>
  <li> merge sort</li>
</ul>
<p>I also made use of the time.h library to seed a call of a rand() function, which was pretty neat since I had no idea that's how it worked in C. Another aspect I had not yet had the chance to use (and fully comprehend) was pointers/addresses (*/&).</p>

More about the algorithms: TBA
